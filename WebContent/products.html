<!-- The “Products” page
If the accessing user is not an owner, the page should only display that 
“this page is available to owners only”.
At the “Products” page the owners of the application can insert 
new products, where each product has a name, unique SKU, category
and price. The name, SKU and list price are collected by text boxes. 
The category is collected by a dropdown menu that presents all categories.

Upon successfully submitting a new product, the owner sees on the 
Products page a confirmation about the products they just submitted.
If the submitted data violate a constraint(eg, non-unique SKU, a list price 
that is not a positive number, a non-provided category, an empty string name, etc)
then the page should simply report “Failure to insert new product”. In the 
“Products” page the owner sees (on the left hand side) one link for each cat
egory. If the user clicks one of the category links then the “Products” 
page will show a table with all products of this category. 
The previous category selection is dismissed. For example, if the user
first clicks on the “Category A” link and then on the Category B” link
then the page will only display “Category B” products 
(the previous, “Category A” selection, is dismissed). 
One of the category links is “All Products” and upon being clicked all products
are shown (unless there is a text search condition, as discussed below.)

Furthermore, the owner may also issue a search for products that 
contain a string provided by the owner in a search textbox.
In response, the “Products” page shows all qualifying products. Note that there
may be two conditions at the same time: 
(a) the category selection and (b) the search box selection.

The displayed products should be those that belong to the selected category 
and match the string of the search box (it is not an “or”).

the search textbox string should be matched against product names only. 
The qualified products must contain the string of the search textbox 
as a substring. No wildcards, regular expressions etc are needed. 
Just plain substring matching.

It may be the case that the category selection is placed first 
and the search box selection second. It could also be vice versa.
The category selection and/or the search box selection should be 
maintained while the user inserts, 
deletes or updates products. For example, assume that the user 
selects “Category A”. Then she successfully inserts a new product.
The newly displayed Products page, in addition to the confirmation 
will also still be displaying “Category A” products. In another 
example, assume that the user selects “Category A” and then searches 
for products containing “foo”. The next displayed page shows “Category 
A” products containing “foo”. Then she updates a product leading to 
an “update failure”. The newly displayed page shows the “update failure” 
message and also still displays “Category A” products containing “foo”.
The table where the qualifying products are displayed has text boxes 
that display (and allow the modification of) the product name, 
product SKU and product price of each displayed product. 
Also, for each product there is a drop down menu that is 
initialized to the category of the product. There is an update 
button next to each product and a “delete” button. 
(Notice, this pattern of displaying data and updating them is 
reminiscent of updating in the students example we saw in class.)
Notes:
9.
Deletions and updates may also lead to constraint violations that 
should be prevented and in such cases the requested modification 
should fail and the user should be informed it failed(“update failure”, 
“delete failure”) by appropriate message at the top of the next displayed 
“Products” page.
10.
Notice that the owner may submit any of the following three requests
in the Products page
either insert a new product in the database 

or search for products by use of the category links and/or search box

or update/delete one of the displayed products
This raises the following question: 
Say, the user has typed a new product in the relevant textboxes but 
then (instead of submitting the new product) he types a string in the 
search box and clicks the “Search” button. What should happen to the 
new product data that he typed but did not submit? For now, nothing 
should happen: the product data will be lost in this case. The same 
tactic applies to the other similar cases. E.g., the user typed a 
new product but then submitted a product update -->

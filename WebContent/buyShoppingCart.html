<!-- The “Buy Shopping Cart” page and the “Confirmation” page
Whenever the session belongs to a customer, a link “Buy Shopping Cart” 
should appear at the top of the page. The link takes the customer
to the “Buy Shopping Cart” page. There, the customer sees the products,
amounts and prices of what he has chosen. He sees the amount 
price for each product and also sees the total price of the shopping cart.
He provides his credit card in a text box and clicks “Purchase”. 
(Ignore the shipping address and shipping method.) A successful purchase
leads to a “Confirmation” page that shows what was bought.
After the purchase the shopping cart is emptied. The data of the purchase (what 
products/quantities were in the boughtcart, who bought, when and at what price) 
are stored in the database. The confirmation page provides a link to the 
“Products Browsing” page so that the customer can start again.
Notes:

Notice that a product’s price may be updated between the time the product was 
placed on the cart, the time it was displayed on the “Buy Shopping Cart” page 
and the time the user actually purchases the cart. Therefore, the displayed 
“amount price for each product” is open to two interpretations: In the first 
interpretation, the price is fixed at the point that the user added the 
product to the cart. In the second interpretation, the displayed price is 
the current price of the product. Choose one of the two interpretations and 
state your assumption. In either case, assume that the final purchase price 
(charged price) is the one that was displayed on the “Buy Shopping Cart”. 
I.e., dismiss the possibility that the price may change after the “Buy Shopping 
Cart” was displayed and before it is purchased.

The insertion of a purchase should be atomic, as the lectures discuss in 
transactional properties.

In later stages we will need the complete information about which carts were 
bought, by whom, when, what products they included, what quantities of each 
product, and at what price each of the purchased products was bought.

It is possible that after the time a product purchase is stored in the 
database, the product name changes.Your database should be organized 
in such a way that the amount of updating that needs to happen in such 
a case, is minimal. -->
